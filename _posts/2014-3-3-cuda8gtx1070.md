When I googled how to install CUDA toolkit on GTX1070, I came across multiple threads that explained how CUDA toolkit 8.0 cannot be installed with the new GTX 1070 (and 1080) because the card is newer than the toolkit and the drivers are not recognized by the toolkit. But when I proceeded to install CUDA toolkit 8.0 and to my surprise, I was able to have it configured without much of a hassle. So I figured it would serve well to lay out what I did.   

### Hardware Configuration

CPU: Core i5-6600(3.3GHz) / quadcore / Skylake 
Mother Board: GIGABYTE GA-B150M-DS3H Durable Edition PC direct 
Memory: Samsung DDR4 8GB PC4-19200  (X2) 
GPU: ZOTAC GeForce GTX1070 MINi D5 8GB

### Software Configuration
OS: Ubuntu 16.4

When you fresh install Ubuntu 16.4 and use the default NVidia graphic driver recommended by the software manager, Ubuntu automatically detects GTX1070 without a problem. Now it remains to install CUDA toolkit 8.0.  

### Verify the system running Ubuntu
1. verify which system the computer is running on. Type on the terminal:  

```sh
$uname -m && cat /etc/*release
```

You should see a line with x86\_64 if you are running a 64bit system.   

2. And verify that it has gcc installed.   

```sh
$gcc --version
```

If gcc is not installed, install it first and proceed to the next.   

3. get the correct Linux kernel.   
According to the CUDA installation guide, CUDA Driver requires that the kernel header and the development packages for the running version of the OS be installed when CUDA is being installed. Although the installation using .deb file will generate the up to date header if no header exists, it might not be the same header for the running kernel. Therefore it is important to manually check that the correct header is installed for the running system.   
Type:  

```sh
$uname -r 
```  

to check the current kernel, and type:  

```sh
$sudo apt-get install linux-header-$(uname -r)
```

to update it to the correct kernel.   

Verifying the system process is necessary for you to know which version of the CUDA toolkit is right for you.  

### Download CUDA toolkit 8.0  
Download Cuda Toolkit 8.0 from https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads. Download the appropriate file that matches your system configuration found above.   

### Install  
And in the terminal, move to the directory where the download file is. For those who need a bit more clarification, if you download the file to the "downloads" folder, type:  

```sh
cd ~/downloads
```

At the time of writing the download file name was   

cuda-repo-ubuntu1604-8-0-local\_8.0.44-1\_amd64  

Type the following code (with the file name appropriately changed if the name is different):  

```
sudo dpkg -i cuda-repo-ubuntu1604-8-0-local_8.0.44-1_amd64.deb
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install cuda
```

Then reboot and set the environment variable by typing the followign code in the terminal:  

```
export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-8.0/bin${PATH:+:${PATH}}
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-8.0/lib64\
{LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}
```

Then test run the following code in the terminal.   

```
$cuda-install-samples-8.0.sh ~
$ cd ~/NVIDIA_CUDA-8.0_Samples/5_Simulations/nbody $ make
$ ./nbody
```  

If a particle simulation window pops up, CUDA toolkit is correctly installed.
